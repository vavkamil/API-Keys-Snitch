# API Keys Snitch
Burp extension to detect &amp; report exposed API keys as an Informative issue

![Issue](screenshot.png?raw=true "API Keys Snitch")

## Description

This repo is an old project that never really worked. After a long time, I decided to create a stand-alone tool outside of the Burp here - https://github.com/vavkamil/js-snitch
